## Built with Jounce

This app was compiled from a single `.jnc` file using the Jounce compiler:

```jounce
component App() {
    let currentHole = signal(1);
    let p1h1 = signal(0);
    let p2h1 = signal(0);

    return <div class="golf-app">
        <h1>Golf Scorecard</h1>
        {/* ... rest of the app ... */}
    </div>;
}
```

**One file** â†’ Beautiful, reactive web app! ðŸŽ‰
